+++

Our mission is to unify all enterprise data in a single, coherent graph managed
by Stardog. Our upcoming Stardog 5 release will include new core APIs.

## Status Quo

We have a kernel API we use and public APIs that everyone else uses. This is at
least two times more APIs than we need.

## The First Big Idea: API Unification

### Protocol Unification, Too

## The Other Big Idea: Reactive Streams

## Beautiful Java API

## Goodbye, Netty. Hello, Undertow!

### What's Next

Our mission is to unify *all* enterprise data. To do that we're adding support
for document handling to the next major release of Stardog.
