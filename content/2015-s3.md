Today we're happy to announce the release of Stardog 3.0.<!--more--> The
culmination of more than 12 months of work, Stardog 3.0 is the best semantic
graph database available. You can download a free evaluation copy of Stardog 3.0
at [stardog.com](http://stardog.com/). Have a peep at the
[release notes](http://docs.stardog.com/RELEASE_NOTES.txt) and

talk about licensing.

# Ready for the Enterprise

Stardog 3.0 includes a production-ready High Availability Cluster, and it's also
the only graph database in the world to support the full OWL 2 graph modeling
language. Stardog's advantage over non-semantic graph databases keeps growing
and puts our customers into a great position to solve *very complex graph
modeling problems*.

## Modeling Complex Data

The simple fact is that non-semantic graph databases are *weak at modeling
complex data*. Dating sites are awesome&hellip;I met my wife on a dating site!
But I don't want my bank or hospital to trust my investment or medical records
to a graph database optimized for dating site startups.

Stardog 3.0 adds equality reasoning to OWL 2, rules, and integrity constraint
validation services to model complex data domains. Stardog is the *only*
scalable graph database that supports the entire OWL 2 specification for rich,
declarative domain models. Modeling *complex, real world problems* is a key
distinguisher for Stardog and will be for years to come.

## Enterprise Premium Support and Maven!

But it's not just HA Cluster and modeling power that makes Stardog 3.0 the best
graph database yet for the enterprise; we've also added
[LDAP authentication](http://docs.stardog.com/#_enterprise_authentication) (with
OAuth coming soon), complete [Maven](http://docs.stardog.com/#_using_maven)
support, and
[Enterprise Premium Support](http://docs.stardog.com/#_enterprise_premium_support)
offerings that give enterprise users the best customer support available
anywhere.

# Goodbye C&amp;P, Hello Complexible

The company behind Stardog is now
[Complexible Inc](http://complexible.com/). A few things to note: all of the Stardog-based
[solutions](http://complexible.com/solutions)--our customers are doing awesome
stuff with Stardog; my epic [co-workers](http://complexible.com/about/);
finally, we're [hiring](http://complexible.com/about/#jobs).

# What's Next?

2015 has been a great year so far; we're growing rapidly, the pipeline is full,
and a lot of good stuff is coming in the 3.x release series. Over the next 6
months we'll do a series of 3.x releases that add new enterprise capabilities to
Stardog:

* HA cluster management, deployment, and monitoring tools;
* virtual graphs via R2RML;
* named graph security; and
* graph traversals via a native TinkerPop 3 implementation.

My thanks to everyone who made 3.0 possible, especially Mike, Evren, Pavel,
Edgar, and Fernando.
